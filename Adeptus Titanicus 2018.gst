For example, a Reaver (Scale 8) cannot attack units within 8&quot; with its carapace weapon, unless the target unit is of at least Scale 8.</description>

If the Titan suffers Catastrophic Damage  as a result of the hit, roll to see if the Titan is turned or moved before rolling on the Catastrophic Damage table. In the Advanced Rules, a Knight Banner that suffers any Direct, Devastating or Critical Hits from a Concussive weapon is automatically Shaken instead (see page 47).</description>

          <description>Before rolling To Hit with a Blast weapon, place the 3&quot; Blast marker or 5&quot; Blast marker (determined by the number in brackets) so that its central hole is completely over the target model’s base and within line of sight of the attacking weapon, and no part of the marker is touching any friendly models. Then, check to see whether the central hole is within range and arc. If it is not within arc, the shot is wasted and has no effect. If it is not within range, do not roll To Hit. Instead, draw an imaginary 1&quot; wide line between the chosen target and the attacking unit, placing the central hole of the Blast marker along this line a number of inches away from the attacking unit equal to the weapon’s Long range characteristic – each shot scatters as follows:
 Once the marker has been placed, roll To Hit as normal. If the roll is successful, the marker is not moved; otherwise, roll the Scatter dice and move the Blast marker D10&quot; in the direction that is shown - if a Hit is rolled, use the small arrow to determine the direction of scatter. Note that the Blast marker can scatter out of the Titan’s line of sight, or out of the weapon’s range or arc this represents the shot ricocheting or blasting clear through intervening terrain. The centre of the firing Titan’s base should still be used as a reference point to determine which of the target’s arcs is hit.
 Whether or not the marker moves, each model that is touched by the marker is hit once. If the central hole of the Blast marker is fully over a model’s base, that model is hit twice.
 If a Blast weapon has a Dice value of 2 or more, make each Hit roll separately (scattering any missed shots individually). If more than one model is hit, the attacking player chooses the order in which to resolve them. Blast weapons cannot make Targeted Attacks. [FAQ - 1.1]</description>

          <description>Some weapons, especially those such as plasma weaponry, can draw additional power from the Titan’s reactor to increase their destructive potential.

However, for each Hit roll of a 1 (before any modifiers or re-rolls), increase the Titan’s Reactor level by 1.</description>

          <description>Warp weapons, most famously warp missiles, are fired in realspace but translate to the Warp for the majority of their flight, only returning to reality as they reach their target. If an attack made by a Warp weapon hits its target, make a Location roll (or choose a location if making a Targeted Attack).
 Then, regardless of whether the target is shielded, roll a D6.
 On a result of 1, the target location loses 1 Structure point. On a result of 2-3, the target location loses D3 Structure points. On a result of 4-6, the target location suffers Critical Damage.
 If the target location is a weapon, on a 1-3 the weapon is disabled. If the weapon is already disabled, it detonates. On a 4-6 the weapon is disabled and the Body loses 1 Structure point. If the weapon is already disabled, it detonates and the Body loses 1 Structure point.</description>

It cannot be placed so that it is touching any friendly units. The closest model to the firing unit that is touched by the template suffers a number of hits equal to the weapon’s Dice value; each other model that is touched by the template (except the firing model!) suffers one hit.

          <description>Composition of a Banner A Banner is made up of a number of Knights acting as a single unit. The reverse of a Banner&apos;s Command Terminal describes its exact composition, along with any options. When a Banner is activated, all of the Knights within it act; individual Knights cannot be activated.
 Banners in the Movement Phase When a Banner is activated in the Movement phase, each Knight can move up to the Banner&apos;s Speed characteristic in inches. Knights are considered to have a 360° Front arc, and can make as many turns as they wish as they move. When the Banner has finished moving, each must be within 3&quot; of another Knight in the Banner - Knight Banners operate in much closer proximity than Titan Squadrons, especially when facing larger war engines. If any of the Knights are outside of this range, the Banner is Shaken - see page 47.
 Banners in the Combat Phase When a Banner is activated in the Combat phase, it follows the Combat Sequence as if it were a Titan. Instead of attacking with each Knight individually, make an attack with each different weapon in tum. For each weapon, multiply the Dice characteristic by the number of Knights in the Banner that are equipped with that weapon, and which are within range and line of sight of the target. For example,ifa Banner has two Knights armed with rapid fire battle cannon (Dice 2) and one Knight armed with a thermal cannon (Dicer),it would roll four dice when attacking with the battle cannon and one dice when attacking with the thermal cannon.IfsomeKnightsarewithin2&quot; ofthetargetandothersare further away, roll using Ballistic Skill for those that are further, and Weapon Skill for those that are within 2&quot;.
 When determining line of sight for a Banner, Knights within the Banner do not block the view of others. Also, remember that Knights have a 360° Front arc,so their weapons can fire in any direction. All of the weapons in a Banner must be fired at the same target, unless the Banner has Split Fire orders, at which point each weapon can be directed at a different target.
 Banners cannot make Smash Attacks.
 ATTACKING BANNERS. When attacking a Banner, pick a single Knight in the Banner to be the target of the attack. This model is used for purposes ofrange,line ofsight and so on. However, any damage that is caused is applied to the Banner as a whole. As Banners do not have Side or Rear arcs, these do not cause modifiers to the Damage roll.
 ION SHIELDS. When fighting in a Banner, Knights align their Ion shields, granting them greater protection as a group than individually. Ion shields are different to void shields;ifa rule refers specifically to void shields, it does not affect ion shields, but ifit refers to Shield saves, it will affect both. Note that, unlike void shields, ion shields can be used against attacks that originate from within 2&quot;. If a Banner is hit by a shooting attack, hits are resolved (at Step 5 of the Combat Sequence) as follows:
• Target&apos;s controlling player makes Ion Shield saves.
• The attacking player makes Armour rolls for any remaining hits. To make an Ion Shield save, look up the Ion Shield level on the Banner&apos;s Command Terminal, which varies depending on the number of Knights currently in the Banner and the Strength of the attack. Then roll a D6 for each hit that was scored. For each dice that equals or beats the Ion Shield level, the hit is discarded. Then for each remaining hit, the attacking player makes an Armour roll as described on page 34.
 DAMAGING BANNERS. Direct Hits, Devastating Hits and Critical Hits affect Banners differently to Titans, as follows:
 Direct Hit: When a Banner suffers a Direct Hit,it loses a Structure point. If it has no Structure points left to lose, one Knight in the Banner is desttoyed instead.
 Devastating Hit: When a Banner suffers a Devastating Hit, it loses two Structure points. If the Banner has one Structure point or no Structure points left when it suffers a Devastating Hit, one Knight in the Banner is destroyed instead.
 Critical Hit: When a Banner suffers a Critical Hit, it loses two Structure points, then one Knight in the Banner is destroyed. If the Banner has one Structure point or no Structure points j left when it suffers a Critical Hit, two Knights in the Banner are destroyed instead.
 When a Knight is destroyed, the controlling player chooses one model to remove. The Banner&apos;s Structure Points marker is then immediately reset to the first hole of the track. If a Targeted Attack destroys a Knight, the attacking player can choose which model to remove instead of the controlling player.
 BLAST MARKERS, FLAME TEMPLATES AND AREA EFFECTS. When a Banner is hit by a Blast marker or Flame template, total the number of hits scored on the models in the Banner, then apply that many hits to the Banner as a whole. This also applies to attack~with an area effect - catastrophic reactor overloads, environmental effects and so on.
 Shaken Banners Each time a Knight is removed from a Banner, the Banner must make a Command check. If it is failed, the Banner is Shaken. It immediately loses any orders and an Order dice showing the Shutdown symbol is placed on its Command Terminal to show that it is Shaken. Shaken Banners subtract 3&quot; from their Speed and will suffer a -1 modifier to all Hit rolls. When the Banner is activated in the Issue Orders step of the next Strategy phase, make a Command roll for the Shaken Banner. If it is passed, remove the dice. Otherwise, it stays where it is. In either case, the Banner cannot be issued orders.

Then roll a D6, adding the Strength value of all contributing weapons, and apply a +1 modifier for each Impale weapon beyond the first that successfully hit.
 If the total of the roll is equal to the target unit&apos;s Scale, roll a D6. On a 1-3, the target unit turns 90° to its right. On a 4-6, the target unit turns to 90° to its left.

          <description>When resolving an attack from a Beam weapon, do not roll To Hit. Instead, pick a target and draw an imaginary, 1mm wide, straight line from the weapon to its maximum range; the line must cross the base of the target at the point closest to the firing model. The closes unit to the firing unit whose base is under the line suffers a number of hits equal to the weapon&apos;s Dice value. If that unit is destroyed, the next closest unit suffers aa number of hits equal to the weapon&apos;s Dice value minus the number in brackets after the trait, to a minimum of 0.
 Continue these steps until a unit is not destroyed, there are no units left underneath the line, or the weapon&apos;s Dice value has been reduced to 0. Beam weapons can only make Targeted Attacks against the closest unit - randomly determine the location for any subsequent unit hit by a Beam weapon.
 When determining the closest unit to be hit, any piece of terrain underneath the line counts as a unit. If a piece of terrain underneath the line is the closest &apos;unit&apos;, the beam carries on as if it had destroyed an enemy unit, i.e, reduce the Dice value and resolve hits against the next unit down the line.
 If the Destroying Terrain special rule is in use, the terrain takes hits as normal however the beam carries on after resolving these even if the building is not destroyed, reducing the Dice value as if it had destroyed an enemy unit.</description>

          <description>Freeblades When a Household marches to war, it is not uncommon for it to be accompanied by ad hoc Banners of Free blades. These might be questing Knights attached to local elements of the Great Crusade or, particularly during the brutal wars of the Horus Heresy, survivors of larger forces allying with another Household as they seek vengeance for their fallen brethren. Units of Free blades are added to the Household force just like Household Support Banners are added to a Titan battlegroup: A Free blade Banner consists of one Support Banner. The Knights in a Support Banner can be armed in any combination. A Free blade Banner cannot join a Lance or benefit from any of the rules that apply to Banners within a Lance. A Free blade Banner cannot be given Coordinated Strike orders. Freeblade Banners cannot be formed into Lances (see below).</description>

These honoured relics bear the heraldry of the Household and its home world, alongside campaign and battle honours beyond number. Their presence on the battlefield provides a rallying point for one and all:
• One Knight within the Seneschal&apos;s Banner may be upgraded to carry the Battle Standard at a cost of 50 points.
• The Battle Standard must be clearly displayed on the model that carries it.
• As long as the Knight carrying the Battle Standard is part of the Banner, any Banner or Lance within 12&quot; of that Knight may re-roll any failed Command checks to see if the Banner becomes Shaken.</description>

          <description>By tradition, a Lance is made up of three Household Banners, with multiple Lances combining to form a Household force. Command of a Lance is generally granted to the most experienced noble present, the highest ranking Knight of the Household taking natural and easy command over their juniors. The commanding Knight is given the rank of High Scion, and is charged with dictating the Lance&apos;s strategic and tactical approaches. Their personality will shape the way that the Lance functions and fights, and such command is highly sought after by ambitious young Knight Scions who wish to prove their worth. Where several Lances are brought together, the most senior noble will assume the rank of Seneschal and take command of all forces in the field. Their decades of experience as both a warrior and statesman prove invaluable in melding the forces under their command into a seamless and efficient fighting force. Knight Scions are bombastic and cantankerous, and Lances drawn from different keeps are often prone to letting competition and internal politics interfere. Without the strong leadership of a respected Seneschal, a Household army risks losing much of its discipline and martial might.

          <description>When assembling a Household force, all Household Banners must be formed into Lances, which in battle operate much like a squadron of Titans would:
• A Lance must consist of three Household Banners.
• A Lance may not contain any Freeblade Banners.
• At least two Banners within a Lance must be of the same type (for example, a Lance may contain rwo Questoris Banners and one Cerastus Banner, but not one Questoris, one Cerastus and one Acastus ). The Knights within each Banner must be armed alike, as described previously, but each Banner within the Lance may be armed differently.
• One Banner within the Lance must be designated as the High Scion&apos;s Banner (see page 37).
• All of the Banners within a Lance count as a single unit for the purposes of deployment and activation. </description>

          <description>Individual Lances are often drawn from a single keep. They will contain Knights that are accustomed to one another and that have trained and fought together for many years. The distinctions of rank and importance between the Banners are subtle, often all but invisible to an outsider, but of the utmost important to the Knightly Households themselves. A Lance is commanded by the most senior noble present, taking the title of High Scion in the field and commanding unswerving respect and duty from their underlings:
• One Banner within each Lance must be designated as containing the High Scion in command of that Lance, rather than a Lord Scion.
• The controlling player must make it clear to their opponent(s) which model represents the High Scion in command of each Lance.
• While the High Scion is part of the Banner, add 2 to the result of any Command checks for it.</description>

          <description>The player chooses one of their units and rolls 2D6. Models within the chosen unit move that many inches in a straight line in a direction chosen by the player, ignoring any rules for movement such as Dangerous or Blocking terrain when moving. If the unit would be placed in a piece of terrain, other than Blocking terrain, the unit suffers D3 S7 hits to its Body, bypassing void shields, and the terrain is destroyed. If the unit would be placed in a piece of Blocking terrain, the unit is destroyed. If the unit would be placed overlapping the base of another unit, the unit stops at its base and suffers a collision. This does not change the unit’s facing and a unit cannot move off the battlefield – if it would, place the unit at the battlefield’s edge.</description>

              1 Bombard Commander: The Seneschal favours a less direct
              approach, using the superior speed of their Scions to avoid
              enemy fire and unleash devastating volleys in return.
              Once per game, all Banners within the Seneschal’s
              Lance can be issued a Coordinated Strike, Split Fire or
              First Fire order without the need to make a Command
              check. Not all Banners need to be issued an order in
              this way, but all Banners must be issued the same Order. 2 Scion of Ryza:The Seneschal has served Ryza honourably
              for centuries, kept alive by ancient technology and bearing
              the greatest artifice its world has to offer. The weapons carried by the Seneschal’s Banner are of
              a higher quality than normal. Increase the Strength
              value of any weapon in the Seneschal’s Banner with
              a starting Strength value of 4 or higher by 1, to a
              maximum of Strength 8.
              3 Favoured Scion: The Seneschal is blessed by the patronage
              of a prominent Magos of Ryza, granted their favour so long
              as they bring no dishonour to their name. One model in the Seneschal’s Banner may be upgraded
              with the Battle Standard Mark of the Omnissiah
              (see page 104) for free. This model must be part of
              a Questor Mechanicus Household to do so and the
              Household Force cannot contain another Battle
              Standard. However, if the Seneschal’s Banner is ever
              Shaken, for the remainder of the battle the Battle
              Standard has no effect and the Seneschal cannot benefit
              from the Noble Sacrifice rules (see page 38 of Adeptus
              Titanicus: Doom of Molech).</comment>

On a 4+, the Titan can roll the Reactor dice twice and choose the result they want.

Legio Vulcanum Titans with twinned machine spirits count as being part of a squadron with each other (see page 45 of the Adpetus Titanicus rulebook).   However, should a Titan with a twinned machine spirit roll the Machine Spirit symbol on the Reactor dice, both it and its paried Titan must make a Command check to see if their Titan&apos;s machine spirit awakens.

Against a target with active void shields, each Hit roll of 5 or 6 causes 2 hits rather than 1. If a roll of 6 To Hit was required, this rule has no effect. Static rounds have no additional effects against targets without active void shields, although the weapon will retain the normal effects of the Rapid trait.</description>

          <description>When chosen by a player they must write the name of one of their Titan&apos;s whose scale is 6 or lower.
                      Play this Stratagem at the start of deployment to set the named Titan to one side and state that it is being held in orbit. Declare and record a round between 2 and 4 - this is the round in which its dropship will aim to deploy the Titan.
                      At the beginning of the Movement phase of the chosen round, roll a D10. If the result is lower than the Titan&apos;s scale, it arrives. Otherwise the Titan is delayed and will arrive at the start of the following Movement phase instead.
                      When the Titan arrives, it may be placed anywhere on the battlefield that is 1&quot; or more from any model or terrain feature, then scatter D6&quot;. Choose it&apos;s facing then roll a D3. On a 1-2, it makes a 45° turn to the left. On a 3-4, it keeps the chosen facing. On a 5-6, it turns 45° to the right. If the Titan scatters or turns into any terrain, it stops before moving into it and the suffers D6 S9 Hits. The Titan cannot be activated in any of the remaining phases of this round. It can still be targeted and attacked as normal.</description>

          <description>This Stratagem can be purchased by any Legio Vulturum player. Play this Stratagem when an enemy Titan moves outside of its Front arc (see Sidestepping and Backing Up in the Adeptus Titanicus rulebook), whether voluntarily or involuntarily. A friendly Legio Vulturum Titan can immediately make an attack with one of their weapon systems against that target, increasing its Reactor Level by 1 to do so. For all intents and purposes, this is a new attack requiring an Attack roll, any additional increases to the Titan’s reactor level, etc.</description>

Play this Stratagem when an enemy Titan suffers Critical Damage in the Combat phase as a result of damage from an attack made by a friendly Legio Vulturum Titan.

          <description>Janissary Battleline maniples learn to coordinate their actions with Household Support units, and move to support them when needed.

          <description>The two Warlord Titans in this maniple represent the King and Queen, whose role it is to support each other in battle. While the King and Queen are within 12&quot; of each other, if one successfully gains an order, the other may gain same order without the need to pass Command check.

                      The Warhounds are the Courtiers, whose role it is to shield the King and Queen. Courtiers can merge their void shields with the King and Queen as if they were part of the same squadron (see p.45 of AT2018 Rulebook). In addition, Courtiers may merge their void shields with either the King&apos;s or Queen&apos;s while within 3&quot; of them, rather than only in base contact.</description>

          <description>Working closely together, the Warhound Titans can surround and pick off foes many times their size. At the beggining of each round, any or all of the Warhounds within the maniple may be formed into a Squadron with other members of their maniple. These squadrons last until the end of the round. In addition, when making Coordinated Strikes (see p.45 of the AT2018 Rulebook), Warhounds in this maniple add +2 to any Armour rolls they make, rather than +1.</description>

          <description>Knight Banners included in a Dominus Battleforce maniple cannot benefit from obscuring cover (see the Adeptus Titanicus rulebook). If a Knight Banner from a Dominus Battleforce maniple is wholly within 6&quot; of a Titan from the same maniple (i.e., all Knights from the Banner are within 6&quot; of the Titan), and both the Titan and at least one Knight from that Banner is visible to the attacker, attacks made against the Titan from more than 2&quot; away from the Titan suffer a -1 modifier to the Hit roll.</description>

          <description>When a Titan in a Dominus Battleforce maniple takes a hit from an attack originating from more than 2&quot; away from the Titan, it may transfer the hit to any Knight model from the same maniple within 6&quot;, as long as that model is visible to the attacker – you must transfer the hit before making any Armour rolls. The chosen Knight suffers the full effects of the hit as if it had been the original target. If the hit was from a weapon with the Blast trait, centre the Blast marker over the Knight. Hits from weapons with the Firestorm or Beam traits may not be transferred in this way.</description>

          <description>A Warbringer-Nemesis Titan from this maniple can attack enemy units indirectly if they do not have line of sight to that unit, so long as the target is within line of sight of a Warhound Titan from this maniple. Firing indirectly in this manner confers a -2 modifier on the Hit roll. In addition, an attack with a Blast weapon from the Warbringer-Nemesis Titan that misses scatters D6&quot; instead of D10&quot; when the target is in line of sight of a Warhound Titan from this maniple.</description>

          <description>Once per round, a Reaver Titan in this maniple can declare Power to Locomotives without pushing their reactor. In addition, when an enemy unit suffers Catastrophic Damage as a result of an attack made by a Warbringer-Nemesis Titan from this maniple, each Reaver Titan from this maniple can immediately make a move as if it was the Movement phase.
                      A Reaver Titan cannot benefit from this ability if it is prevented from moving this turn – for example, due to Emergency Repair orders or the Immobilised Damage Effect.</description>

          <description>Canis Light Maniples can only include Legio Audax Titans. Warhound Titans within this maniple do not deploy as normal. Instead, at the start of the deployment phase, after arranging Titans into squadrons, the controlling player places a number of markers equal to the number of Warhounds in this maniple. These markers can be placed anywhere on the battlefield more than 6” from the enemy deployment zone. Titans from this maniple count as deployed for the purposes of determining which player finished deploying first. When both players have finished deploying as normal, Warhounds from this maniple can be deployed anywhere within 3” of a Pack Ambush marker. Any Warhound deployed in this manner outside of the controlling player’s deployment zone must be at least 50% obscured from any enemy unit within line of sight of that Warhound. If a Warhound cannot be placed within 3” of a Pack Ambush marker in this way, they must be deployed in the controlling player’s deployment zone, following all of the normal rules.

                      If a player has more than one Canis Light Maniple, each maniple beyond the first gives only one extra Pack Ambush marker. Pack Ambush markers are shared between maniples.</description>

          <description>When a Titan within a Firmus Light Maniple is chosen as the target of an attack, the controlling player may nominate a different Titan from this maniple to be the target instead. The nominated Titan must be closer to the attacking unit than the original target, and must be at least 50% visible to the attacking unit. If the attacking unit wishes to, they may make a Command check. If they pass, they may attack their original target. If they fail, they must target the nominated Titan, and can only attack the nominated Titan that round even if they could normally attack more than one unit.

                      A unit can only be forced to take this check once per round, i.e., if they pass, they can target units as normal and are unaffected by this ability for the remainder of the round.</description>

          <description>When this Stratagem is chosen, the player secretly writes down one of their units. The cost of the Stratagem is equal to half the unit&apos;s Scale, rounding up. Play this Stratagem at the start of deployment to set that unit to one side and state that it is outflanking (it is not deployed with the rest ofits battlegroup). Write down which of the battlefield&apos;s neutral flanks it will arrive on, but do not reveal this to the opposing player. While the unit is not on the board, it cannot be activated, and so cannot be issued orders.
                      At the start of the Movement phase of the first round, the unit appears on long range auspex - reveal to the opposing player which neutral flank was chosen. During the Movement phase of the second round, the outflanking unit can be activated. When it is, it is set up so that the Rear arc ofits base is touching the chosen flank. It cannot move any further during the phase.
                      If a player&apos;s battlegroup contains any Squadrons (see page 45), they can choose this Stratagem more than once, as long as each outflanking unit is part of the same Squadron.</description>

              <description>When a player chooses this Stratagem, they must secretly write down the name of one of their Titans which has a Scale of 6 or lower.  Play this Stratagem at the start of deployment to set that unit to one side and state that it is being held in orbit (it is not deployed with the rest of the battlegroup).  Declare (and write down) a round between rounds 2-4 - this is the round in which its dropshop is aiming to deploy the Titan to the battlefield

                              At the begining of the Movement phase of the chosen rouind, roll a D10.  If the result is lower than the Titans Scale, it arrives Otherwise the Titan is delayed and will arrive at the start of the following Movement phase.

                              When the Titan arrives, place it anywhere on the battlefield that is not withing 1&quot; of another model or terrain feature, then scatter it D6&quot;  Once it has been scattered, roll a D3 (typo in book, should say D6), on a 1-2, it makes a 45-degree turn to the left.  On a 3-4, it stays where it is, and on a 5-6 it makes a 45-degree turn to the right.  If the Titan scatters or turns into any terrain, it stops before moving into it and then suffers D6 Strength 9 hits.

                              A Titan that arrives from orbit cannot be activated in any of the phases of the current round, as it is deploying from its dropship.  It can, however, be targed by attacks as normal.</description>
