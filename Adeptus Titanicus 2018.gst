  <readme>Create a Legio Battlegroup by adding a Battlegroup to your Roster. Maniples and Reinforcements can be added directly to a Legio Battlegroup!

To create a Household Battlegroup add a Household to your Roster. Each Lance is a separate Force that needs to be added to your Household. Reinforcements can then be added directly to your Household, or each of your added Lance forces!

NOTE: On mobile, the &apos;add force&apos; dialog adds a Lance automatically when selecting the &apos;Household&apos; catalog in the &apos;Select Catalogue&apos; step (so basically you select &apos;Household&apos; twice). This is more clear on the desktop version of the app where you can clearly see you are selecting a Lance. This is an issue with BS, most likely because there is only 1 Force to choose from.

For example, a Reaver (Scale 8) cannot attack units within 8&quot; with its carapace weapon, unless the target unit is of at least Scale 8.</description>

If the Titan suffers Catastrophic Damage  as a result of the hit, roll to see if the Titan is turned or moved before rolling on the Catastrophic Damage table. In the Advanced Rules, a Knight Banner that suffers any Direct, Devastating or Critical Hits from a Concussive weapon is automatically Shaken instead (see page 47).</description>

          <description>Before rolling To Hit with a Blast weapon, place the 3&quot; Blast marker or 5&quot; Blast marker (determined by the number in brackets) so that its central hole is completely over the target model’s base and within line of sight of the attacking weapon, and no part of the marker is touching any friendly models. Then, check to see whether the central hole is within range and arc. If it is not within arc, the shot is wasted and has no effect. If it is not within range, do not roll To Hit. Instead, draw an imaginary 1&quot; wide line between the chosen target and the attacking unit, placing the central hole of the Blast marker along this line a number of inches away from the attacking unit equal to the weapon’s Long range characteristic – each shot scatters as follows:
	Once the marker has been placed, roll To Hit as normal. If the roll is successful, the marker is not moved; otherwise, roll the Scatter dice and move the Blast marker D10&quot; in the direction that is shown - if a Hit is rolled, use the small arrow to determine the direction of scatter. Note that the Blast marker can scatter out of the Titan’s line of sight, or out of the weapon’s range or arc this represents the shot ricocheting or blasting clear through intervening terrain. The centre of the firing Titan’s base should still be used as a reference point to determine which of the target’s arcs is hit.
	Whether or not the marker moves, each model that is touched by the marker is hit once. If the central hole of the Blast marker is fully over a model’s base, that model is hit twice.
	If a Blast weapon has a Dice value of 2 or more, make each Hit roll separately (scattering any missed shots individually). If more than one model is hit, the attacking player chooses the order in which to resolve them. Blast weapons cannot make Targeted Attacks.
	If a Titan targets a unit with a weapon that has both the Blast (3&quot;/5&quot;) and Carapace traits, and that unit is within a number of inches equal to the firing Titan’s Scale (i.e., cannot be targeted), the attack automatically misses. If that is the case, place the central hole of the Blast template a number of inches away from the firing unit equal to the unit’s Scale — draw a line from the firing weapon directly though the target unit to determine where the hole lands, then scatter the template.

Some weapons have (Draining) after another trait - this means that they do not have the trait by default, but if they push the plasma reactor before attacking with the weapon, it gains that trait for the duration of the attack.</description>

          <description>Warp weapons, most famously warp missiles, are fired in realspace but translate to the Warp for the majority of their flight, only returning to reality as they reach their target.

Then, regardless of whether the target is shielded, roll a D6.
On a result of 1, the target location loses 1 Structure point. On a result of 2-3, the target location loses D3 Structure points. On a result of 4-6, the target location suffers Critical Damage.

          <description>Battlefield Assets can be targeted by attacks, and are hit by Blast markers, Flame templates and area effects (such as exploding reactors) in the same way as a unit. Hit rolls against Battlefield Assets have a -1 penalty at Short range and a -2 penalty at Long range.
Units can move across Battlefield Assets without penalty. If a Titan&apos;s base crosses a Battlefield Asset as it moves, there is a chance it will crush it underfoot. Ifit does so, roll a Dro,or a D6 if the Titan&apos;s move ends with its base over the Battlefield Asset. If the result is lower than the Titan&apos;s Scale, the Battlefield Asset is destroyed.</description>

          <description>After resolving an attack from an Impale weapon against a Titan, do not make an Armour roll. Instead, roll a D6 if the attack hit, adding the Strength of the weapon to the result. If resolving an attack from an Impale weapon as part of a Coordinated Strike, resolve the attacks of all contributing Titans first, making a note of how many attacks from Impale weapons successfully hit. 
Then roll a D6, adding the Strenght value of the Impale weapon, using the highest Strenght value of all contributing weapons, and apply a +1 modifier for each Impale weapon beyond the first that successfully hit to the result of the roll.

If the total of the roll is equal to or lower than the target unit&apos;s Scale, roll a D6. On a 1-3, the target unit turns 90° to its right. On a 4-6, the target unit turns to 90° to its left. If the total of the roll is higher than the target unit&apos;s Scale, the target unit turns as described above and the immediately suffers D3+1 Devastating Hits to its Legs. If the target unit suffers Catastrophic Damage as a result of this attack, do not roll on the the Catastrophic Damage table - the target unit automatically suffers the Laid Low result instead. If a natural 1 is rolled, nothing happens to the target unit and each unit that contributed to the attack and scored one or more hits against the target unit immediately suffers a Devastating Hit to their Legs and a S7 hit against any Impale weapons that successfully hit as part of the Coordinated Strike.

          <description>When resolving an attack from a Beam weapon, do not roll To Hit. Instead, pick a target and draw an imaginary, 1mm wide, straight line from the weapon to its maximum range; the line must cross the base of the target at the point closest to the firing model. The closes unit to the firing unit whose base is under the line suffers a number of hits equal to the weapon&apos;s Dice value. If that unit is destroyed, the next closest unit suffers aa number of hits equal to the weapon&apos;s Dice value minus the number in brackets after the trait, to a minimum of 0.
Continue these steps until a unit is not destroyed, there are no units left underneath the line, or the weapon&apos;s Dice value has been reduced to 0. Beam weapons can only make Targeted Attacks against the closest unit - randomly determine the location for any subsequent unit hit by a Beam weapon.
When determining the closest unit to be hit, any piece of terrain underneath the line counts as a unit. If a piece of terrain underneath the line is the closest &apos;unit&apos;, the beam carries on as if it had destroyed an enemy unit, i.e, reduce the Dice value and resolve hits against the next unit down the line.
If the Destroying Terrain special rule is in use, the terrain takes hits as normal however the beam carries on after resolving these even if the building is not destroyed, reducing the Dice value as if it had destroyed an enemy unit.</description>

          <description>Unlike other Banners that are part of a Lance in a Household force, the individual Knights within the Seneschal&apos;s Banner may be equipped differently, following the options available to a Support Banner of the same type of Knight. This allows the player to better represent the unique, elite warriors that make up the Seneschal&apos;s companions. However, if this option is taken, the Banner may not be issued with Coordinated Strike orders</description>

On a 1, nothing happens but the stratagem is not discarded and he can be played again in a subsequent round.</description>

          <description>This Stratagem may be purchased by any Traitor player. Play this Stratagem in any phase. The player chooses one of their units and rolls 2D6. Models within the chosen unit move that many inches in a straight line in a direction chosen by the player, ignoring any rules for movement such as Dangerous or Blocking terrain when moving. If the unit would be placed in a piece of terrain, other than Blocking terrain, the unit suffers D3 S7 hits to its Body, bypassing void shields, and the terrain is destroyed. If the unit would be placed in a piece of Blocking terrain, the unit is destroyed. If the unit would be placed overlapping the base of another unit, the unit stops at its base and suffers a collision. This does not change the unit’s facing and a unit cannot move off the battlefield – if it would, place the unit at the battlefield’s edge.</description>

          <description>This Stratagem can be purchased by any Loyalist player. Play this Stratagem when a friendly Titan suffers Catastrophic Damage, before rolling on the Catastrophic Damage table. Instead of rolling on the table, roll a D6. On 1-4, the Titan suffers the Magazine Detonation result, and on a 5+ the Titan suffers the Catastrophic Meltdown result. Add 1 to the result if the Titan’s Reactor Status marker is in a hole with an orange indicator and add 3 if it in a hole with a red indicator.</description>

The player chooses one of their Titans; the first time Critical Damage is suffered by that Titan it is ignored – do not move the marker up the tracker. Any other effect, such as loss of Structure points, still occurs. If a Titan is forced to move the Critical Damage marker more than once for an attack, move it one fewer space. Then, discard this Stratagem.</description>

          <description>This Stratagem may be played once in each Strataegy phase of the game. When this Stratagem is played, place two markers anywhere on the table wholly within a piece of terrain (this does not need to be the same piece of terrain). Instead of activating a Titan or Knight Banner, a player may fire with these markers as if they were units, following all the rules for making attacks and using the profile below.

BS/WS: 5+
Arc: 360
Short: 6&quot;, +1 To Hit
Long: 12&quot;
Dice: 4
Strength: 5

If more than one player has this Stratagem, players take turns when placing their markers, beginning with the First Player. If two opposing markers are placed in the same piece of terrain, immediately remove both markers. After resolving the effects of any attacks it makes, remove that marker from the battlefield. Any marker not activated is removed during the End phase of a round.</description>

At any point during the Titan&apos;s activation the player may discard the marker to cool the Titan&apos;s reactor. To see how effective this is, roll 2D10 and add 5:

If the result is 7-15, reduce the Titan&apos;s reactor by D3 levels.

If the result is 16-24, reduce the Titan&apos;s reactor by D6 levels.

          <description>Any Legio Interfector Titan Reaver or Warhound Titan armed with a Vulcan Mega-bolter may take static rounds for +15 points. A Titan equipped with static rounds uses a modified version if the Rapid trait when firing its Vulcan Mega-bolter. Against a target with active void shields, each Hit roll of 5 or 6 causes 2 hits rather than 1. If a roll of 6 To Hit was required, this rule has no effect. Static rounds have no additional effects against targets without active void shields, although the weapon will retain the normal effects of the Rapid trait.</description>

          <description>Any Legio Atarus Titan armed with Apocalypse missile launchers, Apocalypse missile arrays or an Apocalypse missile launcher can be upgraded to have Infernus missiles for +25 points, so long as that Titan does not already have an upgrade affecting that weapon. Each of the Titan’s weapons must be upgraded separately. A weapon with this upgrade gains the Voidbreaker (2) trait. In addition, if a unit suffers at least one hit from a weapon with this upgrade, place a 5&quot; Blast marker under the unit. In the End phase, any model with at least part of its base on the marker takes a Strength 4 hit, ignoring void shields and ion shields. After resolving any hits, the fire goes out and the marker is removed. Titans suffer this hit to their Legs. In addition, Blocking terrain touched by the marker takes a Strength 4 hit (see the Adeptus Titanicus rulebook for details on damaging and destroying terrain) and, if not destroyed, is set alight. In the End phase, burning terrain suffers a Strength 4 hit, and deals a Strength 4 hit to any models in it, as detailed above.
The fire then goes out.</description>

          <description>When a Legio Interfector Titan is activaed in the Movement phase, it&apos;s player may choose to allows the madness of its Princeps to take over.  When this madness takes over, roll (a D3) on the table below:

                        1 - Dark Embrace:  The Titan gains the Charge order. It must move toward the nearest visible enemy Titan or Knight Banner by the shortest route possible, stopping if it reaches base contact with another model, and then make a smash attack, or attack with a single weapon with the Melee trait.
                        2 - Weapon Overload:  The Titan gains the First Fire order. When the Titan would fire in the Movement phase, randomly choose one of the Titan&apos;s weapons without the Melee trait and make an atack with this weapon against the nearest enemy Titan or Knight Banner, counting the weapon&apos;s Strength as 2 higher than normal and its Dice as 1 higher than normal.  After the attack has be resolved, disable the chosen weapon.
                        3 - Static Scream: All Titans and Knight Banners, both friendly and foe, within 12&quot;of the Titan must remove their Orders, except Emergency Repair orders. Titans who lost their Orders before activated are not subject to any of the lost Order&apos;s restrictions

          <description>This Stratagem can be purchased by any Legio Tempestus player. Play this Stratagem at the start of deployment, before any units have been placed upon the battlefield. Choose a friendly Legio Tempestus Titan of Scale 7 or lower to be kept in reserve; that unit is not deployed as normal and instead will arrive by combat drop.

At the start of any Strategy phase from the second round onwards, the chosen Titan is deployed by combat drop. Place the Titan anywhere on the battlefield more than 3&quot; away from an enemy unit then scatter the Titan D6&quot;. If the Titan scatters into a piece of Terrain, it stops before moving into it and suffers D3+2 Strength 9 hits (Void Shield saves are allowed). If, after it scatters, the Titan’s base overlaps with another model, friend or foe, with a Scale lower than the Titan’s, move the Titan the shortest distance so its base is not overlapping then resolve the effects of a Collision. If the Titan’s base overlaps that of a unit with a Scale equal to or greater than its own, the Titan is destroyed; do not roll on the Catastrophic Damage table. The unit it overlapped with suffers a Collision as normal.

A Titan that arrives in this way cannot be activated in the Strategy phase or Movement phase in the round it arrives. [FAQ - 1.4]</description>

          <description>Any Legio Vulturum Titan that is equipped with a vulcan mega-bolter or vulcan mega-bolter array can be upgraded with Storm Frag shells at a cost of +25 points for a vulcan megabolter and +45 points for a vulcan mega-bolter array. Each weapon a Titan is armed with must be upgraded separately. A weapon with this upgrade gains the Maximal Fire trait and increases the negative Acc modifier for the weapon’s Long range by 1 (i.e., a 0 becomes a -1, a -1 becomes a -2).</description>

Each weapon a Titan is armed with must be upgraded separately. After resolving an attack made by a weapon with this upgrade, the Titan may immediately make a second attack with this weapon against the same target, applying a -1 modifier to all Hit rolls for that attack. After resolving the second attack, the weapon is disabled and the upgrade has no further effect for the remainder of the battle, even if the weapon is subsequently repaired.</description>

          <description>If an enemy unit&apos;s shields are collapsed by an attack made by a Warhound Titan from this maniple, the Reaver Titan in this maniple can immediately make an attack against it with one of its weapons, following the Combat Sequence on page 33. This means that the Reaver can potentially attack several times in same phase, as well as attacking normally when it is activated. However, if the Reaver is preventd from attacking in the Combat phase - it has Striking Speed of Shutdown orders, for example - it cannot make these bonus attacks.</description>

          <description>Titans in this maniple can choose to move outside og their forward arc (see Sidestepping and Backing Up on p.30 of the AT2018 Rulebook) at their full movement rather then having to use 2&quot; of movement for every 1&quot; moved.

          <description>The two Warlord Titans in this maniple represent the King and Queen, whose role it is to support each other in battle. While the King and Queen are within 12&quot; of each other, if one successfully gains an order, the other may gain same order without the need to pass Command check.

                        The Warhounds are the Courtiers, whose role it is to shield the King and Queen. Courtiers can merge their void shields with the King and Queen as if they were part of the same squadron (see p.45 of AT2018 Rulebook). In addition, Courtiers may merge their void shields with either the King&apos;s or Queen&apos;s while within 3&quot; of them, rather than only in base contact.</description>

          <description>Working closely together, the Warhound Titans can surround and pick off foes many times their size. At the beggining of each round, any or all of the Warhounds within the maniple may be formed into a Squadron with other members of their maniple. These squadrons last until the end of the round. In addition, when making Coordinated Strikes (see p.45 of the AT2018 Rulebook), Warhounds in this maniple add +2 to any Armour rolls they make, rather than +1.</description>

          <description>Knight Banners included in a Dominus Battleforce maniple cannot benefit from obscuring cover (see the Adeptus Titanicus rulebook). If a Knight Banner from a Dominus Battleforce maniple is wholly within 6&quot; of a Titan from the same maniple (i.e., all Knights from the Banner are within 6&quot; of the Titan), and both the Titan and at least one Knight from that Banner is visible to the attacker, attacks made against the Titan from more than 2&quot; away from the Titan suffer a -1 modifier to the Hit roll.</description>

          <description>When a Titan in a Dominus Battleforce maniple takes a hit from an attack originating from more than 2&quot; away from the Titan, it may transfer the hit to any Knight model from the same maniple within 6&quot;, as long as that model is visible to the attacker – you must transfer the hit before making any Armour rolls. The chosen Knight suffers the full effects of the hit as if it had been the original target. If the hit was from a weapon with the Blast trait, centre the Blast marker over the Knight. Hits from weapons with the Firestorm or Beam traits may not be transferred in this way.</description>

          <description>When a Titan in a Fortis Battle maniple is in base contact with another Titan in the maniple, and neither Titan moved in the Movement phase, the Titan ignores Armour roll modifiers resulting from Structural Damage or being attacked in the flank or rear (see page 34 of the Adeptus Titanicus rulebook).  In addition, Titans in a Fortis Battle maniple may merge their void shields (see page 45 of te Adeptus Titanicus rulebook)

          <description>A Warbringer-Nemesis Titan from this maniple can attack enemy units indirectly if they do not have line of sight to that unit, so long as the target is within line of sight of a Warhound Titan from this maniple. Firing indirectly in this manner confers a -2 modifier on the Hit roll. In addition, an attack with a Blast weapon from the Warbringer-Nemesis Titan that misses scatters D6&quot; instead of D10&quot; when the target is in line of sight of a Warhound Titan from this maniple.</description>

          <description>Once per round, a Reaver Titan in this maniple can declare Power to Locomotives without pushing their reactor. In addition, when an enemy unit suffers Catastrophic Damage as a result of an attack made by a Warbringer-Nemesis Titan from this maniple, each Reaver Titan from this maniple can immediately make a move as if it was the Movement phase.
                        A Reaver Titan cannot benefit from this ability if it is prevented from moving this turn – for example, due to Emergency Repair orders or the Immobilised Damage Effect.</description>

          <description>Canis Light Maniples can only include Legio Audax Titans. Titans within this maniple do not deploy as normal. Instead, at the start of the deployment phase, after arranging Titans into squadrons, the controlling player places a number of markers equal to the number of Titans in this maniple. These markers can be placed anywhere on the battlefield more than 6” from the enemy deployment zone. Titans from this maniple count as deployed for the purposes of determining which player finished deploying first. When both players have finished deploying as normal, Titans from this maniple can be deployed anywhere within 3” of a Pack Ambush marker. Any Titan deployed in this manner outside of the controlling player’s deployment zone must be at least 50% obscured from any enemy unit within line of sight of that Titan. If a Titan cannot be placed within 3” of a Pack Ambush marker in this way, they must be deployed in the controlling player’s deployment zone, following all of the normal rules.

If a player has more than one Canis Light Maniple, each maniple beyond the first gives only one extra Pack Ambush marker. Pack Ambush markers are shared between maniples.</description>

          <description>During the Combat phase, when a Titan from this maniple makes an attack with a weapon without the Melee trait, it may increase the Strength value of the weapon by 2 for the duration of the attack. This must be declared before rolling to Hit. If it does so, increase the Titan’s Reactor level by 1 (or 2 if the weapon has a Dice value of 5 or greater), in addition to any other advances associated with weapon fire.</description>

The nominated Titan must be closer to the attacking unit than the original target, and must be at least 50% visible to the attacking unit. If the attacking unit wishes to, they may make a Command check. If they pass, they may attack their original target. If they fail, they must target the nominated Titan, and can only attack the nominated Titan that round even if they could normally attack more than one unit.

                        A unit can only be forced to take this check once per round, i.e., if they pass, they can target units as normal and are unaffected by this ability for the remainder of the round.</description>

          <description>When this Stratagem is chosen, the player secretly writes down one of their units. The cost of the Stratagem is equal to half the unit&apos;s Scale, rounding up. Play this Stratagem at the start of deployment to set that unit to one side and state that it is outflanking (it is not deployed with the rest ofits battlegroup). Write down which of the battlefield&apos;s neutral flanks it will arrive on, but do not reveal this to the opposing player. While the unit is not on the board, it cannot be activated, and so cannot be issued orders.

At the start of the Movement phase of the first round, the unit appears on long range auspex - reveal to the opposing player which neutral flank was chosen. During the Movement phase of the second round, the outflanking unit can be activated. When it is, it is set up so that the Rear arc of its base is touching the chosen flank. It cannot move any further during the phase.

If a player&apos;s battlegroup contains any Squadrons, they can choose this Stratagem more than once, as long as each outflanking unit is part of the same Squadron.</description>

                      <description>Choose a class of Titan from the following list: Warlord, Reaver, or Warhound. The Titan Legion may always substitute one of the mandatory Titans in a maniple with a Titan of this type. Note, this substitute Titan only benefits from maniple rules that reference Titans but does not benefit from maniple rules that reference a specific class of Titan.

For example, if the Reaver from a Venator Light Maniple was replaced with a Warlord Titan, the Warlord would not benefit from the Opportunistic Strike rule – this rule specifically references a Reaver Titan. However, if a Reaver from an Axiom Battleline Maniple was replaced by a Warlord, the Warlord would benefit from the Might of the Omnissiah rule as that refers to Titans in the maniple.</description>

                      <description>Titans from this Legio can move at full speed when Backing Up (see the Adeptus Titanicus rulebook).

If they do this, increase the Titan’s Reactor Status level by 1. Each Titan can only do this once per round. Thismove and attack is resolved after the effects of the Charge order and the subsequent attack have been resolved.</description>

          <description>Any Traitor Titan equipped with a weapon with the Ordnance or Rapid trait can be upgraded with a Corrosive Payload for a cost equal to a points cost of 5 x the weapon’s Dice value (e.g., a Warhound’s Vulcan mega-bolter would be +30 points), so long as that Titan does not already have an upgrade affecting that weapon. Each of the Titan’s weapons must be upgraded separately. Once per game, a weapon with this upgrade can fire its Corrosive Payload. When it does so, add 1 to all Armour rolls for that attack.</description>

          <description>All Corrupted Titans must purchase a Base Mutation at the appropriate cost.
All Corrupted Titans can purchase a number of Additional Mutations at the appropriate cost, chosen from the list of Additional Mutations.
Corrupted Titan subtracts 1 from the result of any Command check it makes. If a Corrupted Titan has purchased one or more Additional Mutations, it instead subtracts 2 from the result of any Command check it makes.
Theabove listed penalties to Command checks suffered by Corrupted Titans cannot be ignored due to Legio Traits (for example, the Legio Kulisaetai’s Callous Trait) or Princeps Seniores Personal Traits. However, these penalties can be ignored as a result of Stratagems, Titan Wargear or other special rules.
If the machine spirit of a Corrupted Titan is awakened, roll a D6 and look up the result on the Awakened Entity table instead of rolling on the Awakened Machine Spirit table. Unless otherwise stated, a special rule that allows you to choose a result on the Awakened Machine Spirit table also allows you to choose the result on the Awakened Entity table.
A Corrupted Titan commanded by a Princeps Seniores rolls a D6 on the Corrupted Titan Personal Trait table (see page 164) instead of rolling a D6 on the Personal Trait table. If both players agree then they can each pick a Personal Trait instead of rolling a D6. A Corrupted Titan that has been declared as part of a Titan Legio may roll on, or pick from, its specific Personal Trait table.</description>

          <description>Any of the Legio’s Titans can be upgraded to have Ablative Ceramite Plating for +30 points. At the start of the battle, a Titan equipped with Ablative Ceramite Plating can choose either its Body, Legs or Head. The Titan ignores the bonus to the attacker’s armour roll as a result of damage already inflicted on the chosen location, as indicated by the Command Terminal (see the Adeptus Titanicus rulebook).

Additionally, if the Head is chosen, in a campaign the Titan’s crew will always survive the destruction of their Titan on a 2+ (see page 87 of Adeptus Titanicus: Titandeath).</description>

Each of the Titan’s weapons must be upgraded separately. When firing a weapon equipped with Diabatic Warheads, the player can choose to use its normal profile, or fire using Diabatic Warheads; if they do this, reduce the weapon’s Strength value to 1. If an attack made with Diabatic Warheads scores at least 3 hits, regardless of whether the Void Shield saves are passed or not, increase the target Titan’s Reactor Status Level by 1. If 8 or more hits are scored, increase the target’s Reactor Status level by 2 instead. Diabatic Warheads have no additional effect on Knight Banners, beyond any damage they may inflict.</description>

          <description>Any Warbringer Nemesis Titan from this Legio can be upgraded for 5 x half the Strength of the weapon (e.g., a volcano cannon would be +30 points). The weapon gains the Barrage trait and applies only a -1 modifier rather than a -2 modifier when making attacks at targets it does not have line of sight to. The Barrage trait can only be used if the Warbringer Nemesis Titan has not moved this turn (voluntarily or involuntarily).

Take 1 selection for each half strength of the weapon you are upgrading.</description>

              <description>Any Corrupted Titan may be upgraded with the Daemonic Bile mutation for +15 points. Once per round, during the Combat phase, a Titan with this mutation can spew Daemonic Bile. Daemonic Bile counts as an additional weapon and follows the rules for attacking as normal (see page 33 of the Adeptus Titanicus rulebook). 
Daemonic Bile has a Short Range of T, Long Range of -, Dice value of D3, S5 and the Firestorm and Fusion traits. 
This mutation cannot be used if the Titan has suffered Critical Damage to its head. Daemonic Bile is unaffected by Titan Legion rules (such as the Legio Infernus’ Masters of Flame trait), Maniple rules (such as the Ignus Light Maniple) and cannot be upgraded with Wargear (such as the Legio Infernus’ Clinging Phosphex).</description>

          <comment>1 Titan Stalker: The Princeps is adept at taking down larger
prey, knowing just how to exploit their weaknesses if they
can get close enough.
When targeting a Titan that is within 12&apos;&apos;, the Princeps
Seniores may add r to the Armour rolls of any hits,
provided that the targeted Titan has a Scale either equal
to or greater than their own.
2 Humardu Savage: Some of the primitive humans harvested
from Humardu by the Tiger Eyes would eventually join their
ranks; although despite years of psycho-conditioning they still
retained much of their savage nature.
When the Princeps Seniores Titan makes a Smash
Attack (see page 36 of the Adeptus Titanicus rulebook),
add 2 to the Strength of the attack.
3 Trophy Taker: The Tiger Eyes are known to claim
trophies from their fallen foes, their Princeps going so far
as to tear limbs and heads off enemy Titans as a display of
their savage dominance.
Any weapon disabled by the Tiger Eyes Princeps using a
Smash Attack, or a weapon with the Melee trait, is harder
to repair; these require a dice score r higher than normal
when making Repair actions. </comment>

          <comment>D3 PERSONAL TRAIT
I Razor Tongue: The Princeps is skilled at delivering biting
challenges and chilling threats, unnerving their opponents even
before the first blow is struck.
At the start of the round, the Princeps can choose an
enemy Titan within 24&quot; of their own Titan. For the
duration of the round, the chosen Titan&apos;s Command
characteristic is increased by 2 , to a maxim um of 10.
2 Bloodied but Unbroken: The more damage the
Princeps&apos; Titan sustains, the more driven they become,
seeking to ensure that even should they fall, their enemies are
sure to fall with them.
For each point of Critical Damage the Princeps&apos; Titan
has suffered (not including Critical Damage inflicted
on weapons), increase the Strength of any weapons
with the Melee trait and their Smash Attacks by r,
to a maximum of +3.
3 Cruel: The Princeps has no pity for weaklings. Unworthy foes
are swiftly crushed underfoot with little thought of honour or
mercy- after all, what mercy does the boot give the ant?
When making attacks against units with a Scale of 5 or
lower, increase the Strength of any hits by 2. </comment>

      <description>Each maniple in a battlegroup may replace a single optional Warhound Titan with a Dire Wolf Titan. Legio Audax maniples may replace a single mandatory Reaver or a single optional Warhound Titan with a Dire Wolf Titan instead; this allows the fielding of Legio Audax maniples that were previously inaccessible to the Legio, such as Ferrox or Venator maniples, so long as the maniple includes no Titan of Scale 7 or more when assembled. Dire Wolf Titans count as the Warhound or Reaver they replace for the purposes of maniple rules.</description>
